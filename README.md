# django
Bastille Template to create a Django Development Jail

 STATUS: Testing

This creates a django development environment, not in a virualenv, but in the jail.  This was
installed with PIP into the base system. There is virtualenv installed if you need it.

vim-console was also included for editing files, but you have to add your own IDE if you need
one.
